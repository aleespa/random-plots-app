\text{The image reveals hypnotic patterns traced by}\\
\text{a point orbiting two interlinked circles. Each}\\
\text{curve emerges from the dance between a primary}\\
\text{rotation and a counter-spin scaled by ratios}\\
\text{\(k = a/b\) and \(l = c/d\). The path follows:}\\
s(t) = (1 - k)e^{it} + kle^{-it\frac{1 - k}{k}}\\
\text{Here, \(k\) sets the size ratio between circles,}\\
\text{while \(l\) adjusts the secondary loop's reach.}\\
\text{As \(t\) evolves, the phase cancellations and}\\
\text{reinforcements between rotations sculpt petal-like}\\
\text{forms. Multiple spirographs overlap, their}\\
\text{color-shifted layers echoing the interplay of}\\
\text{order and controlled chaos in modular motion.}
