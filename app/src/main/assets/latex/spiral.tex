\text{The image unveils spiral arms emerging from}\\
\text{recursive transformations. Each point evolves via:}\\
x_j = 1 + y_{j-1} - c|x_{j-1}| \quad \text{and} \quad y_j = -0.99x_{j-1}\\
\text{The term \(c|x|\) introduces gentle nonlinear}\\
\text{damping, while the near-perfect inversion \(-0.99x\)}\\
\text{drives rotational momentum. Initial randomness}\\
\text{generates distinct cores, with color gradients}\\
\text{tracing outward flow. As iterations progress,}\\
\text{trajectories balance between circular recurrence}\\
\text{and exponential drift â€“ creating barred spirals}\\
\text{that hover at the edge of stability and dispersal,}\\
\text{their galactic forms born from deterministic chaos.}
