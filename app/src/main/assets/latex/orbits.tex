\text{The image depicts orbital paths emerging from}\\
\text{iterative transformations. Each orbit evolves}\\
\text{through a balance of attraction and repulsion,}\\
\text{guided by the recursive equations:}\\
x_j = 1 + y_{j-1} - c \cdot |x_{j-1}| \quad \text{and} \quad y_j = -x_{j-1}\\
\text{Here, c introduces subtle rotational shifts.}\\
\text{Points spiral outward, their trajectories}\\
\text{reshaped by the tug-of-war between linear growth}\\
\text{and nonlinear distortion. Colors distinguish}\\
\text{unique starting conditions, revealing how minute}\\
\text{changes cascade into intricate, galaxy-like}\\
\text{patterns of order and divergence.}
