\text{The image portrays celestial patterns formed by}\\
\text{proximity and chance. Points scatter randomly,}\\
\text{then connect if within a critical distance \(r\):}\\
\[
\sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2} < r
\]\\
\text{This creates a cosmic web where "stars" bond}\\
\text{through geometric nearness rather than gravity.}\\
\text{Colors distinguish individual bonds, while}\\
\text{unlinked points remain isolated. The emergent}\\
\text{constellations balance randomness with local}\\
\text{order â€“ fleeting alliances in a mathematical}\\
\text{universe governed by radial thresholds and}\\
\text{uniform distribution.}
