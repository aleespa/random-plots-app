\text{The image explores fragmented planes through}\\
\text{randomized quadrilaterals. Each shape is defined}\\
\text{by four vertices \((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)\),}\\
\text{\((x_3, y_3), (x_4, y_4)\), where coordinates}\\
\text{are drawn uniformly from \([-1, 1]\). Colors}\\
\text{shift along a spectrum, while transparency}\\
\text{adjusts based on shape density. Overlapping}\\
\text{layers create a mosaic of intersecting}\\
\text{geometric forms â€“ a deconstructed canvas}\\
\text{where randomness and structure collide in}\\
\text{a kaleidoscope of abstract spatial relationships.}
