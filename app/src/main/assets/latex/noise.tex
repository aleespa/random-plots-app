\text{The image is a visual exploration of structured}\\
\text{chaos, blending randomness and order through}\\
\text{recursive mathematical functions. Each pixel's}\\
\text{color results from layered operations — sums,}\\
\text{products, and oscillations — shaped by sine}\\
\text{waves and conditional thresholds. A simplified}\\
\text{layer may be expressed as:}\\
\[
f(x, y) = \sin\left(\alpha + \beta \cdot x\right) + \sin\left(\gamma + \delta \cdot y\right)
\]\\
\text{where \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta\) introduce}\\
\text{phases and frequencies, generating textured,}\\
\text{organic noise. The outcome is a balance of}\\
\text{predictable patterns and surprising irregularities.}
