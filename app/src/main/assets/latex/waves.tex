\text{The image captures a cascade of undulating waves}\\
\text{shaped by stochastic motion. Each wave evolves as:}\\
y_k(x) = \sin(B(x)) \cos(x) + 1.6k\\
\text{where \(B(x)\) is a Brownian bridge – a random walk}\\
\text{constrained to return to zero. The sine term}\\
\text{modulates the bridge's fluctuations, while the}\\
\text{cosine introduces periodic ripples. Layers stack}\\
\text{vertically, their colors shifting along a gradient}\\
\text{to distinguish individual waveforms. The interplay}\\
\text{of randomness and periodicity creates organic}\\
\text{patterns, resembling wind-swept dunes or}\\
\text{ocean swells – a harmony of chaos and rhythm.}
