\text{The image captures a dance between radial expansion}\\
\text{and rotational drift. Each polygon's vertices follow:}\\
x = k \cos(\theta) + \cos(k), \quad y = k \sin(\theta) + \sin(k)\\
\text{where k scales the shape while sinusoidal terms}\\
\text{induce swirling offsets. As k grows, polygons}\\
\text{spiral outward while their angular displacement}\\
\text{creates interference patterns. The number of sides n}\\
\text{anchors the base symmetry, and color gradients map}\\
\text{the progression. Varying line weights and overlapping}\\
\text{paths generate depth, evoking the infinite reflections}\\
\text{of mirrored recursion through geometric feedback.}
